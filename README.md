A simple pixel art tool.

Choose your canvas size by inputting a number in the text field and clicking "Apply".  The length and width of the canvas will be equal to the number input.

Click on the blocks to fill them in. Click on it again to erase it.

Select a color by clicking on its corresponding circle.

Click the "Reset Canvas" button to start over.
